                <h2>Get Insights From Your Data</h2>
                <p>We are Data Analytics experts, and we have been adding value to our clients’ businesses by deriving insights from data for years. We use modern analytics and data engineering processes to unlock the data hidden in your systems, model it explicitly for your business, and create insights that help <em>drive your business forward</em>.</p>

                <h2>Gather Data From Every Facet Of Your Business</h2>
                <p>Data lives in every nook and cranny of your business. We can help you <em>consolidate every data source into a 360 view of your organisation</em>. Even the smallest businesses have many sources of data; whether it is user behavior from your website, marketing and sales intelligence from your CRM system, or financial data from your accounts team.</p>

                <h2>Trust Your Data Sources</h2>
                <p>Your decisions are only as good as the information you use to make them. If data quality is not a priority in your business you run the risk of making bad ones. We ensure that your data is <em>integrated</em>, <em>modeled</em> and <em>tested</em> so that you know the KPIs you rely on to run your business are accurate and meaningful.</p>

                <h1>We’re Tableau Experts</h1>

                <h2>Tableau Dashboarding and Reporting</h2>
                <p>Tableau is our favourite data visualisation and dashboarding tool. We love how simple it is to <em>create meaningful dashboards</em> from any data source, whether it is a database in the cloud, your own data warehouse or even a local spreadsheet.</p>
                <p>We know you will love it too; we can get you started with Tableau, create new reports and dashboards and help train your team to get powerful insights from your data.</p>

                <h2>Tableau Server Administration</h2>
                <p>Insights from data can only add value to your organisation when you share them. We can help you compliment your Tableau Desktop work with Tableau Server, communicating your important metrics to your team, your customers, or the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>We’ve spent years optimising data extracts for Tableau Server, so we know exactly how to get the most value out of your dashboards.</p>

                <h2>Tableau Online Experts</h2>
                <p>If you don’t want to support your own infrastructure, we can help you get going on Tableau Online, or migrate your data from Tableau Server to Tableau Online.</p>

                <h2>Web Analytics Implementation</h2>
                <p>We have carried out many web analytics implementations; from small business blogs to SAAS applications with hundreds of thousands of users. Each implementation is explicitly tuned to the needs of an individual business. We help you decide what is important to measure to best optimize your business, and then implement <em>fast, user-focused, GDPR compliant tracking</em> that helps you get the best from your website or app.</p>

                <h2>Web Analytics Insights and Reporting</h2>
                <p>We’ll enrich the data you receive from your web analytics platform with your internal data sources to get you a <em>holistic view of your customers</em> and their behaviour. We will help you derive impactful insights about your customers that will help you make the right decisions to improve your <em>bottom line</em>.</p>

                <h1>Data Warehousing Consulting</h1>

                <h2>Your Data Is Valuable</h2>
                <p>Every time you make a decision you need the best information you can get. No longer should you need to worry about whether one number is ‘correct’ or try to compare data from two different sources that really describe two different things. You’re busy; you don’t have time to worry about the provenance of your data.</p>
                <p>We help <em>increase the value</em> of your data, so everything you need is one place; <em>documented</em> so you know what it describes, and <em>tested</em> so you know you are making the right decision.</p>

                <h2>Business Focused Data Warehouse Modeling</h2>
                <p>We design data warehouses and data marts that accurately describe your business processes so that your data is available, timely, and <em>reliable</em>. You will always be sure that the KPI in your dashboard actually measures what you think it measures.</p>

                <h2>Analytics Engineering With dbt</h2>
                <p>Data has to be transformed and aggregated so your reporting is accurate. We use dbt (Data Build Tool), a SQL based development environment, to ensure that all data transformations are testable, version controlled and <em>documented</em>.</p>
